## üéØ The Problem: Silent Technical Debt
As a **Senior Android Engineer** specializing in architectural health, I know that **Technical Debt** isn't just about messy code‚Äîit's about slow build times, large APK size, and decreased team productivity.

The first, easiest, and often overlooked step in cleaning up this debt is removing **dead resources** (unused drawables, old icons, forgotten layouts, and XML files) that silently bloat your codebase.

## üöÄ Real-World Proof: The Unstoppable Wallet Test
To prove its effectiveness, we ran `AndroidCodeCleaner` on the highly reputable and well-maintained open-source project, **[Unstoppable Wallet](https://github.com/horizontalsystems/unstoppable-wallet-android)**.

| Metric | Result |
| :--- | :--- |
| Total Resource Files Scanned | **351** files |
| Total Code/XML Files Scanned | **1,497** files |
| **Dead Resources Identified** | **17 critical resources!** |

**Conclusion:** This tool found **17 forgotten resources** ready for deletion, even in a well-managed codebase. This proves its precision and immediate value.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Use (30-Second Setup)
`AndroidCodeCleaner` is built on Kotlin Script, requiring minimal setup and no complex Gradle configuration.

### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the [Kotlin command-line compiler](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/command-line.html) installed on your system.

### Running the Script
1.  Place the `scripts/find_unused_resources.kts` file in the root of your Android project (the same level as your `app/` folder).
2.  Run the script directly from your terminal:

```bash
kotlinc -script scripts/find_unused_resources.kts
```
**Note:** This tool only **reports** files; it **does not delete** anything. Manual review and deletion are required.
